Triple DES CLI Encryption and Decryption

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) application that implements the Triple DES encryption and decryption algorithm. Triple DES is a symmetric key encryption technique, providing enhanced security through multiple iterations of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm.

Features:
- Encrypt and decrypt plaintext using Triple DES.
- Supports key sizes of 16 or 24 bytes (112 or 168 bits).
- Optional mode selection (e.g., ECB, CBC, CTR) for enhanced encryption.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository and build the project.
2. Run the CLI application to encrypt or decrypt your data.
3. Use optional parameters to select encryption mode and provide input/output files.

Contributions and Feedback:
We welcome contributions from the open-source community and feedback from users. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or create a pull request.

Note:
This project is for educational purposes and should not be used in production environments without proper security reviews.
